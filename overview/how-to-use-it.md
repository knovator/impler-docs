# ðŸ§¿ How to Use it?

Impler is built around configuring your import once and letting the user import spreadsheets data every time using Widget.

### Let's Configure your Import

Impler is organized in the structure of `Project`, `Template` and `Columns`.&#x20;

* You can create a new `Project` for every app you want to give Import functionality.
* Each `Project` can have multiple types of data, in Impler it is called as `Template`.
* The `Template` has `Columns` that specify fields in data. For example, _users'_ data has `firstname`, `lastname`, `email` fields.

To **Create Project**, **Add a Template** to it and **Specify Columns** you can use Swagger UI or can directly call the API from the steps mentioned below:

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="1) Create Project" %}

{% endtab %}

{% tab title="2) Add Template" %}

{% endtab %}

{% tab title="3) Specify Columns" %}

{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

### Let's Embed Import Widget in your App

Once you have configured what you want to import you can embed a `Widget` in your application that allows users to import data.

If your application is built using React, you can add a Widget using [react-component.md](../widget/react-component.md "mention") or You can use [iframe-embed.md](../widget/iframe-embed.md "mention").

Now your App is ready to import files, The imported data will get sent to the API endpoint you specified while creating the project.
